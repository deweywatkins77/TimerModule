## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## Usage

Once the module is imported, the syntax for use is funcTimer(function1,function2,...functionN, iteration integer, parameters). funcTimer will pass all the parameters to all the functions and run each function the number of times set by the iteration integer. funcTimer will then return an object containing the results of each function, the average time it took to run each function, and which function was fastest.
